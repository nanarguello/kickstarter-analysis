# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis is to find trends and form conclusions based on the dataset provided by our client Louise. The file handed over to us contains information on thousands of crowdfunding campaigns. For each of them, we have data on their goal, the amount pledged, the outcome, the country of origin, the category and the date of creation, among other useful facts.

## Analysis and Challenges

The first step I took to analyze the dataset was taking the time to look at the data to familiarize myself with it. After that, I created a pivot table to show the outcomes of the theater campaigns based on their launch date. I filtered the table by category and years, placed months in the column and the outcomes for the rows. In order to show the months in the column, I had to learn to group. I did so by reviewing the following link from Microsoft’s official website: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/group-or-ungroup-data-in-a-pivottable-c9d1ddd0-6580-47d1-82bc-c84a5a340725?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us
Then I created a new spreadsheet so as to visualize the percentage of successful, failed and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount. I did this by applying the COUNTIFS formula. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The most difficult challenge I experienced was learning how to effectively use the COUNTIFS formula. I repeatedly received an “Inconsistent Formula Error” message, so I spent a lot of time investigating on the Internet and applying different changes to the code until I was able to find out what the problem was. Ultimately, this turned out to be an enriching experience, as the research I was forced to perform gave me a deeper understanding of the formula. My conclusion is that in Data Analysis, difficulties are expected and, most importantly, needed to lay the foundations for strong problem-solving skills. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- By looking at the Pivot Table and the Line Chart, we can infer that during the months of May and June Theater campaigns tend to be more successful, and in comparison, December could be the least favorable month.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- We can conclude that there is a better chance of success when campaigns have lower funding goals, specifically up to $4999. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- One important piece of information we do not have on this dataset is how long it took for each successful campaign to reach their funding goal. If we had that information in the dataset, we could deduce the ideal campaign duration. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
-We could create a Pie Chart to show the outcomes of a category of campaigns in a specific country. We could also create a Histogram to visualize the distribution of the data.
